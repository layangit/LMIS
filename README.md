# LMIS – Logistics Monitoring Intelligence System

An AI-powered construction site monitoring and intelligence platform designed to reduce material loss, detect unauthorized movement, and improve operational efficiency through drone-based surveillance and rule-based analytics.

---

## Project Overview

Construction sites manage thousands of materials, tools, and equipment across large zones. Manual supervision and paper-based tracking often lead to:

- Misplaced materials  
- Delayed deliveries  
- Unauthorized movement  
- Increased operational costs  
- Safety and theft risks  

LMIS (Logistics Monitoring Intelligence System) provides a role-based intelligent monitoring platform that:

- Tracks asset movement across defined zones  
- Detects rule violations automatically  
- Generates prioritized alerts  
- Supports operational and security decision-making  
- Enables scalable monitoring for large-scale construction projects  

This system is designed to support large-scale projects such as mega construction developments and smart city initiatives.
