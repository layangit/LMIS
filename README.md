# LMIS – Logistics Monitoring Intelligence System

An AI-powered construction site monitoring and intelligence platform designed to reduce material loss, detect unauthorized movement, and improve operational efficiency through drone-based surveillance and rule-based analytics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Construction sites manage thousands of materials, tools, and equipment across large zones. Manual supervision and paper-based tracking often lead to:

- Misplaced materials  
- Delayed deliveries  
- Unauthorized movement  
- Increased operational costs  
- Safety and theft risks  

LMIS (Logistics Monitoring Intelligence System) provides a role-based intelligent monitoring platform that:

- Tracks asset movement across defined zones  
- Detects rule violations automatically  
- Generates prioritized alerts  
- Supports operational and security decision-making  
- Enables scalable monitoring for large-scale construction projects  

This system is designed to support large-scale projects such as mega construction developments and smart city initiatives.

🎓 Academic Context
This system was developed as part of a System Analysis & Design course and progressed through the following phases:

System Vision & Requirements Documentation

Functional & Non-Functional Specifications

Use Case Modeling & UML Diagrams

High-Fidelity Prototyping (Figma)

Frontend Implementation (React + TypeScript)

Cloud Deployment

The goal was to transform a structured system design into a functional, deployable web application.
